### A. Glossary

- **Operating Hours:** The time window during which a room is available for booking (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Slot Duration:** The minimum bookable time unit (default: 1 hour)
- **Consecutive Slots:** Multiple adjacent time slots booked together
- **RLS:** Row Level Security - Postgres security feature for data access control
- **Monorepo:** Single repository containing multiple related projects

### B. Assumptions

1. All times are stored in UTC and converted to local time in the client
2. Booking cancellation is allowed up to 1 hour before start time
3. Users can have multiple active bookings
4. Rooms operate on the same schedule every day (no day-specific hours in MVP)
5. Admin users are created manually in Supabase dashboard
6. One booking = one or more consecutive slots in a single room

### C. Success Criteria

**Launch Criteria:**

- All Phase 1-5 deliverables complete
- Zero critical bugs
- Performance requirements met
- Security audit passed
- At least 5 test users successfully complete booking flow

**Post-Launch Success:**

- 100+ registered users in first month
- 80%+ booking completion rate
- < 1% error rate
- Positive user feedback (4+ star rating)
