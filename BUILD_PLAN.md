## Build Philosophy

### Execution Principles

1. **Bottom-Up Approach:** Start with infrastructure, then backend, then frontend
2. **Vertical Slices:** Build complete features end-to-end before moving to next
3. **Test Early:** Write tests alongside features, not after
4. **Deploy Often:** Deploy to staging after each major milestone
5. **Documentation:** Document as you build, not retrospectively

### Critical Path

```
Monorepo Setup → Database → Auth → Rooms → Bookings → Admin Features → Polish
```

## Tips for Execution

### 1. Start Small, Iterate Fast

- Don't try to build everything at once
- Get each feature working before moving on
- Deploy early and often

### 2. Prioritize Ruthlessly

- Must-haves first, nice-to-haves later
- If stuck, move on and come back
- Don't over-engineer

### 3. Test As You Go

- Write tests alongside features
- Manual test after each task
- Fix bugs immediately

### 4. Use the Right Tools

- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Leverage Supabase features
- Use established libraries

### 5. Stay Organized

- Keep tasks in a project board (GitHub Projects)
- Update build plan as you go
- Document decisions

### 6. Ask for Help

- Supabase Discord
- Stack Overflow
- GitHub issues for libraries
